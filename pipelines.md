# Published Pipelines

* [Eco-Flow/synteny](https://github.com/Eco-Flow/synteny) - A pipeline that compares gene synteny between chromosome level genome assemblies. It takes genomes and gff (annotation) files and compares the macrosynteny using a variety of programs.

* [Eco-Flow/excon](https://github.com/Eco-Flow/excon) - A pipeline that runs gene family expansion and contraction analysis (via CAFE). This pipeline automates the analysis to run the basic steps in EXpansion and CONtraction of gene families, as well as running GO enrichment analysis on the output.

# Custom config files

* [Eco-Flow/configs](https://github.com/Eco-Flow/configs/tree/main) - A repository to store custom configuration files we develop for our community.

# Pipelines in Development

* [Eco-Flow/pollen-metabarcoding](https://github.com/Eco-Flow/pollen-metabarcoding) - A pipeline to process meta barcoding data and assign species and produce tables/figures appropriate for this analysis.
