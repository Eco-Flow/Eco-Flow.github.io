# Citations 

Citations for research related to the pipelines is dependant on the completion of specific publications that first use the workflows (under collaborators who helped build the pipeline). 

If a pipeline is not yet published, we recommmend that you write up your methods manually and cite each program that the overall pipeline uses, you should also add a URL to the pipeline github repository.
