# Open Jobs

## Workflow developer and advocate

**Location**: UCL, London

**Salary**: Up to spine point 25 (6b): £34,605–£39,980 

**Contract length**: 2 years (Full time)

**Fully funded by**: BBSRC- Bioinformatics and Biological Resources Fund

**Goal**: Building a Bioinformatics Ecosystem for Agri-Ecologists

**Start date**: Between May 2024 – August 2024

**Requirements**: Undergraduate degree (Master’s/ PhD preferred)

**Role**: Write and develop bioinformatics workflows for the agri-ecology community 

**Summary**: Omics approaches are revolutionising all aspects of the biosciences, including agriculture and food production. The BBSRC recognises this and the critical role that agri-ecologists play in mitigating these challenges. Yet, this community is at risk of falling through the omics gap, and their potential curtailed due to mismatch in the productivity of agri-ecologists and the bioinformatics skills and resources they need to analyse their data. 

Our Project aims to support this community, such that UK agri-ecologists can contribute to workflow assembly, can use our user-friendly bioinformatics pipelines and quickly get the results they need to power their science. We use Nextflow, which provides intuitive, seamless 'plug-and-play' modular platforms, delivering pipelines that are state-of-the-art, reproducible and scalable, to push forward the field for the greatest number of projects/people.

**Main roles**: Working within the agri-ecology community, you will liaise with project partners and help them build Nextflow pipelines to process their data. You will monitor and address Github issues and feature requests to continually improve the workflows. You will be fully engaged with nf-core, and aim to write pipelines using the best possible practices. You will help teach basic Nextflow courses and advanced topics (in partnership with the Co-I) every six months in locations across the UK. You will help organise events and perform administrative tasks.

**Travel**: Role will involve multiple trips to Seqera Labs, Barcelona for summits, workshops, and six-monthly trips to UK universities to jointly run training sessions.   

**Ideal candidate**: Someone who loves to write Nextflow and is a problem solver, that is comfortable working with many end-users through Github and works well in a team.:
