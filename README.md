# Welcome to EcoFlow

An organisation funded by the BBSRC to promote the development of an agri-**eco**logy specific Next**flow** pipeline community and development program.

Our goal is to help researchers develop Nextflow code, teach basic and advanced topics around the UK and build functional pipelines to super charge UK research.

# Why

Agri-ecology research is critical for our understanding of the natural environment and the security of our food supply. In the UK, we have some of the world leading research labs trying to tackle these key issues. However, bioinformatics skills in these areas lag far behind other research fields such as medicine; this bottleneck is holding back research and the speed at which this critical research gets published, with a knock-on effect to hampering recommendations for urgently-needed policy change.

# Our plan

 **1. BUILDING**

We will develop (within end-user communities) reproducible, easy-to-use, modular bioinformatics pipelines suitable for the most useful analyses required by ecologists in the application of omics data to address critical ecological questions. Specifically, we will use Nextflow (https://www.nextflow.io/), a world leading pipeline development structure to create these pipelines.

 **2. TESTING**

Once we have developed our pipelines, we will ensure each module has unit testing (using nf-test; https://shorturl.at/kpQ39), as well as end to end pipeline tests with example data. Alongside our ambassadors and partner labs we can ensure pipelines are continuously tested and improved, so they remain active and relevant.

 **3. TRAINING**

We address this mismatch by building resource bridges between ecologists – especially those working at the interface of insect ecology and agriculture - and bioinformatics; we will empower them with the autonomy to access and use the most appropriate cutting-edge analyses. Let’s remove the black box of bioinformatics!
